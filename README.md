 Setup
 ECMA2017 was used
 Node Version - v6.11.2
 Google Chrome Version 67.0.3396.99
 API- https://api.unsplash.com/. Unsplash API was used, which only allowed 30 photos per call. So the workaround was to call twice at app init, and then cache the results.


 Dependencies
 There are no dependencies and no frameworks were used.

 Running
 To run, simply enter the command npm i and npm start. Application runs on http://localhost:3000/.

 Approach
 This code challenge was done in Vanilla JS. Sass was used a pre-processor for css. The build tools used were webpack ^4.20.2 and webpack dev server ^3.1.9. The plugins used were
 html-webpack-plugin ^3.2.0 and mini-css-extract-plugin ^0.4.3.
